# Charleston Traffic Alerts Bot for Slack

## How to run this sorry excuse for a bot
Go get Slack and Bing Maps tokens / keys, and put them in a tokens.txt file in the same folder as index.php, like so:
```
slack:1234-abcd-5678
bing:abcd-1234-efgh
```

Use cron to run this sucker on an interval.

## Why PHP?
Because I knew you would hate it.
